<span id="project-objective">

## 🎯 Objective
> The project aims to develop a performance management and project monitoring platform focused on providing visibility and dynamic insights into metrics and indicators. The platform will be integrated with Taiga and will allow viewing of data such as the number of cards created and completed, average execution time, distribution by employee, among other relevant indicators. With different access levels (Operator, Manager and Administrator), the system will ensure that each profile only views information relevant to their role. The solution aims to improve efficiency, transparency and data-driven decision-making in project management.

<br>

## 📌 Solution
> To meet the challenges of performance management and project monitoring, a platform integrated with Taiga will be developed, which will consolidate and present strategic indicators through dynamic and accessible dashboards.

The solution will have the following main features:
  - **Integration with Taiga:** automatic extraction of data related to projects, such as tasks, status, execution time and those responsible.
  - **Interactive dashboards:** views of statistics such as the number of cards created and completed, average execution time, distribution of tasks by member, among other relevant indicators.
  - **Access control by profile:**
    - **Operator:** access only to data for tasks under their responsibility.
    - **Manager:** expanded view of time performance under their leadership.
    - **Administrator:** global access to all indicators for all projects.
  - **Basis for strategic decisions:** visualizations facilitate continuous monitoring of project progress and decision-making based on real data.

> The platform will promote greater efficiency, transparency and agility in project management, optimizing the monitoring of deliveries and team performance.
