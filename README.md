<span id="project-objective">

## 🎯 Project Objective
> The project aims to develop a performance management and project monitoring platform focused on providing visibility and dynamic insights into metrics and indicators. The platform will be integrated with Taiga and will allow viewing of data such as the number of cards created and completed, average execution time, distribution by employee, among other relevant indicators. With different access levels (Operator, Manager and Administrator), the system will ensure that each profile only views information relevant to their role. The solution aims to improve efficiency, transparency and data-driven decision-making in project management.
